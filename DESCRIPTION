Description: Developed to help researchers who need to model the kinetics of carbon dioxide (CO2) production in alcoholic fermentation of wines, beers and other fermented products. The following models are available for modeling the CO2 production curve as a function of time: 5PL, Gompertz and 4PL. This package has different functions, which applied can: perform the modeling of the data obtained in the fermentation and return the coefficients, analyze the model fit and return different statistical metrics, and calculate the kinetic parameters: Maximum production of carbon dioxide; Maximum rate of production of CO2; Moment in which maximum fermentation rate occurs; Duration of the latency phase for CO2 production; CO2 Produced until Maximum fermentation rate occurs. In addition, a function that generates graphs with the observed and predicted data from the models, isolated and combined, is available. Gava, A., Borsato, D., & Ficagna, E. (2020).
